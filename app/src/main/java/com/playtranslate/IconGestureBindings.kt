/**
 * What the floating icon's gestures do.
 *
 * Each gesture has its own enum of candidates, so a binding can only ever
 * name an action that gesture can perform, and the icon's dispatch in
 * [OverlayUiController] is an exhaustive `when` per gesture: a candidate
 * added here cannot compile until it is wired there, nor until it has a
 * title and says which source languages offer it. This shared face is what
 * the Settings surfaces render, the "On the floating icon" cell and the
 * picker page it opens: a title per candidate, and whether the current
 * source language offers it. "Open the quick menu" and the swap are each
 * offered on two gestures and so are each a constant in two enums, sharing
 * their strings; [IconGestureBindings.quickMenuReachable] is the one place
 * that treats the two menu constants as the same thing.
 *
 * Stored per gesture by enum name; see [Prefs.iconGestureBindings].
