/**
 * Furigana (ruby) demotion: drops the small kana readings printed beside kanji
 * from the region list BEFORE grouping, so they never become their own group,
 * never reach the translator, and never get an overlay.
 *
 * A user setting, on by default (`Prefs.filterFurigana`, Japanese source
 * only, gated by the caller). Off, the pipeline is byte-identical to before.
 *
 * ## The rule, from the typesetting facts
 *
 * Furigana is a kana reading, set at half the base size, attached to the
 * kanji it reads: above a horizontal line, to the right of a vertical column,
 * with no leading between them. Each clause is one term, and the constants
 * are nominal values with slack rather than fitted numbers:
 *
 *  1. **Reading** ([isRubyText]): at least one syllabic kana, and at most
 *     [MAX_HAN_IN_READING] Han, outnumbered by the kana. A reading never
 *     contains a kanji, but a recognizer reads one into it now and then
 *     (`ん` as `人`, `ー` as `一`, `ま` as `中`); that is a single misread, so
 *     one kanji is tolerated and two are not (`何を買おうか？` is a sentence,
 *     not a reading). `々` counts as Han. Latin, digits and punctuation are
 *     tolerated (misreads inside a reading); a read with no kana is never
 *     ruby.
 *  2. **Attached**: the candidate's nearest line on its ruby side — the
 *     nearest line BELOW it if that line is horizontal, the nearest column to
 *     its LEFT if vertical (columns run right to left, ruby precedes its
 *     column) — overlapping it along the reading axis by at least
 *     [OVERLAP_MIN] of the candidate's own extent and within [REACH_EM] of
 *     that line's em, must contain Han ([hasHan]). Nearest, not any: a
 *     kanji line further away with a kana line in between is not the
 *     candidate's base. [REACH_EM] is a sanity bound on the search, not a
 *     discriminator — the size tests decide, and a corpus sweep from half
 *     an em to a full one added nothing but junk reads; [GAP_MIN_EM] admits
 *     the overlap of padded detector boxes.
 *  3. **Half-size**: glyph size is measured from the glyphs, not from the
 *     OCR line box, wherever the engine lets us. Two glyph measurements:
 *      - **character pitch**, the start-to-start distance from one character
 *        box to the next along the line, which for square CJK glyphs is the
 *        glyph size ([charPitch]; the median when there are several; extent
 *        over count when a line has no boxes). Needs [PITCH_MIN_CHARS]
 *        characters on BOTH lines (one character has no "next"; a lone kanji
 *        base's whole width is not a pitch). The base's pitch must be at
 *        least [PITCH_RATIO_MIN] times the candidate's (nominal 2.0).
 *      - **line height** (width for vertical): the base must be at least
 *        [SIZE_RATIO_MIN] times taller (nominal 2.0).
 *     How the two combine depends on whether the engine measures glyphs,
 *     read off the base line's char tier ([GlyphScale.hasMeasuredCharTier]):
 *      - **Glyph-measuring engines** (ML Kit, Meiki): line boxes hug the
 *        glyphs and character boxes sit where the glyphs are, so both
 *        measurements are trustworthy and BOTH must say half-size (height
 *        alone when the read has one character). The spacing test is
 *        applied per RUN: a read whose characters are separated by a hole
 *        of at least one base character (て over 手 and い over 入, with に
 *        between them, read as one region) is several readings, so it is
 *        cut at every such hole ([splitRuns]) and every run must pass — a
 *        run of two or more on spacing, a single character by the height
 *        already required — and at least one run of two or more must exist
 *        and pass. That last clause is what keeps letter-spaced titles
 *        (ふ し ぎ な ほ し) out: they cut into single characters only, and
 *        single characters carry no spacing evidence.
 *      - **PaddleOCR**: both measurements are biased toward refusing and
 *        neither toward accepting, so EITHER suffices. Its detector boxes
 *        inflate small text by a roughly constant amount (15 px ruby glyphs
 *        come back as 20 to 26 px boxes) while leaving large text alone, so
 *        true ruby's height ratio lands at 1.2 to 1.9. And its character
 *        positions are sequence positions, not glyph positions: a read that
 *        merges two ruby runs across a base character between them
 *        (なかはい, なか over 中 and はい over 入) comes back with its four
 *        characters spread evenly over the box, the hole invisible, so its
 *        pitch reads like body text (Thor 2026-09-10: height 1.67, pitch
 *        0.97). A read that fails both is refused: single-character reads in
 *        padded boxes and hole reads whose padded height also falls short.
 *
 * Rotated regions and whole-region (manga-ocr) regions are neither candidate
 * nor neighbour. The rule is local and existential: no page-level statistic,
 * nothing to fail open on.
 *
 * ## Why two size axes
 *
 * The cross-axis line box carries content noise: on a glyph-tight engine a
 * kana-only column measures narrower than a kanji column of the same font,
 * by up to 1.6 times on ML Kit, inside ruby's range. Character pitch is
 * immune to that noise because full-width advance does not depend on glyph
 * shape: a kana body column advances one em per character, ruby half an em.
 * An earlier version of this filter compensated for the noisy axis with a
 * tight gap cap instead, and leaked on the first real game screen, whose
 * ruby sat further from its base than any corpus manga's.
 *
 * ## Why pitch is measured from character positions, not the count
 *
 * Extent over count assumes the characters tile the extent. A recognizer
 * that merges two ruby runs across the un-annotated base characters between
 * them (いっしょ over 一緒 and か over 買, read as one region) breaks that: the
 * hole inflates the extent, and whether a filler glyph gets emitted for the
 * hole moves the count, so the same box on an unchanged screen read 1.63 on
 * one pass and 1.36 on the next (Thor, 2026-09-09) and the reading flickered
 * in and out. Where the engine places its characters at the glyphs — ML
 * Kit's symbol boxes, Meiki's per-character detections — the median
 * start-to-start distance is the ruby size whatever the holes do, as long as
 * ruby-sized distances are at least half of them. Paddle's CTC cells do NOT
 * place characters at the glyphs (see above), and even-tiled tiers
 * (manga-ocr) give the fallback's number, so on those engines this measure
 * equals the count. On the base side the median also stops half-width
 * digits (`18` in 未成年(18歳未満) from deflating the base pitch.
 *
 * ## Census (source of record: scripts/ruby_census.py)
 *
 * Corpus: ocr-grouping/runs/results-1786212247819.jsonl, 57 Japanese seeds,
 * four engines, the `flowgraph` column, 2022 regions: 131 demotions, every
 * one a reading of a kanji in its base line, no body line demoted. Against
 * the earlier gap-capped rule the general form gains three misread readings
 * containing kanji no list anticipated (`小らおり`, `なかー中`, `なか上`) and
 * loses five merged-fragment reads. One Thor capture (2026-09-09, Meiki, a
 * mobile game's parental-notice screen): 26 demoted, 8 body lines kept,
 * including the two reads the capped rule leaked (`いっしょいか` at a 0.30 em
 * gap; `ほうていたいりに人`).
 *
 * The exposure that remains, stated so the device pass looks for it: a one-
 * or two-character kana body line adjacent to a larger kanji line on the
 * ruby side, which a glyph-tight engine measures at 1.5 times narrower. No
 * second axis exists for a two-glyph read. Also not handled: ruby beyond
 * half an em from its base, left-side vertical ruby (dual readings), ruby
 * printed below a horizontal line, slanted ruby, and Chinese zhuyin/pinyin
 * ruby (the reading test is kana-based). Ruby the recognizer merges INTO its
 * base line's text is a recognizer problem, not a box problem, and stays.
 * The corpus is manga-heavy and under-samples menu screens; the debug row
 * plus a device pass on real game menus is the validation for that
 * population, and the DEBUG `RubyFilter` log line in
 * [com.playtranslate.ocr.OcrPipeline] makes every demotion re-checkable.
 *
 * ## Decisions
 *
 * Demoted regions are REMOVED from the grouping input rather than carried as
 * a flagged group: marking would have to thread through classification, the
 * overlay, and tombstones for no v1 benefit. They are returned separately
 * ([Result.demoted]) for the debug-box overlay and the log only. The two
 * existing scale gates that stop ruby from MERGING (FlowGraph's
 * `linkScaleCap`, `LayoutAnalyzer.interposingLine`) are untouched; with the
 * flag on they simply never see ruby.
