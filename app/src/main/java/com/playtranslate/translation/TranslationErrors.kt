/**
 * Decides which translation errors reach the user as a pill, from each
 * waterfall pass's online outcomes ([OnlineAttempt]). Rules, as decided on
 * 2026-09-26:
 *
 *  - **Once per outage.** After an error's pill has appeared, the same error
 *    (same [TranslationErrorKey]) stays quiet until its owner has recovered
 *    STEADILY and then fails again. Steadily means: a success after its last
 *    failure, then no failure of it for [STEADY_RECOVERY_MS]. So a service
 *    that keeps flipping between working and failing (Gemini's free tier
 *    under auto-translate, flaky wifi) shows its pill once, and a real fix
 *    re-arms it. A different kind from the same service is a different
 *    error and shows. A pill still up says its owner's newest failure, even
 *    one already seen this outage.
 *  - **Per capture session.** When capture ends (Turn Off, MediaProjection
 *    not turned on, the capture backend switching or torn down), everything
 *    here is forgotten, as at an app restart ([reset]): an error still in
 *    effect shows once in the next session. Without this, a service that
 *    never works again (out of credits, a bad key) would stay silent for the
 *    rest of the process. Hide for Now is not an end: capture carries on
 *    without the floating icons, and so do the pills.
 *  - **Hidden on recovery.** A pill comes down the moment its owner works
 *    again: the service's own success, or for the connection's, any server
 *    answering at all, even with an error (a 429 proves the network works).
 *    The × closes it any time. Either way the error still counts as shown.
 *  - **Shown means on screen.** A pill shows whenever there's an error,
 *    whatever is in front (Gilad, 2026-09-27), and an error counts as shown
 *    only once [TranslationErrorPresenter.show] actually put it up. A pill
 *    taken down because its display left the capture set ([withdrawn]) stops
 *    counting: nobody closed it, so it shows again at its next failure.
 *  - **Transport failures** ([BackendFailureKind.isTransport]) belong to the
 *    connection when no service reached a server in the pass and the
 *    network is missing or not validated (airplane mode, a captive portal,
 *    wifi without internet); otherwise to the service. A pass that reached
 *    a server never blames the connection, even if the network reads as
 *    gone by the time the pass is judged: the answer is the fresher proof.
 *    The network is read when the report arrives, so it only speaks for a
 *    request nothing newer is known about: a transport failure whose pass
 *    reached no server, reported after a request sent later reached a
 *    server or failed on the connection, is the connection's (a request
 *    that hung through an outage and reported once it was over). Every
 *    failure shows, the first one included (Gilad, 2026-09-27): a one-off
 *    hiccup's pill comes down at the next success anyway.
 *
 * **Evidence is dated by when its request went out** ([OnlineAttempt.sentAtMs]),
 * never by when it arrived: passes overlap, and a slow request reports after
 * a newer one. So an owner's pill follows its newest request, whatever order
 * the reports come in: a failure puts the pill up or rewords it only if
 * nothing sent after it has reported (a success or another failure), and a
 * success takes the pill down only if no failure was sent after it. The
 * steady clock runs on the same dates. A
 * report older than what it would speak for is dropped:
 *  - sent before the capture session's history began ([reset]);
 *  - about a service, sent before the user last changed it ([forget]): the
 *    request was made with the key, model or address they replaced. Its
 *    server answer still proves the connection worked; nothing else about
 *    it counts.
 *
 * Nothing is persisted (Gilad, 2026-09-26): a fresh process starts with no
 * history, so an error still in effect after a restart shows again at its
 * next failure.
 *
 * Main thread only; [TranslationErrors] posts every pass here.
